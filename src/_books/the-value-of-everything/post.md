Mariana Mazzucato is one of the most important modern economists. The last 40 years of economic
thought have given more and more weight to the innovative power unleashed in free markets. We’ve now
seen the limits of this magic and how important it is to not just have guardrails but programs of
innovation directly sponsored and managed by the state. Mariana’s book The Entrepreneurial State
does a lot of the work of debunking these free-market myths.

This more recent work expands on these ideas to provide a broader framework to understand where
value comes from and how we should organize society to reward it, encourage it and benefit from it.
