Going from agriculture straight to laissez-faire economies doesn’t work. But it is pursued
nevertheless, sometimes with pressure from Washington and a misguided IMF. I’m very interested in
harmful ideas and this might be one of the big ones. This book explains why it’s so harmful and what
must be done instead.

[As Noah Smith puts it](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1029783616098787328)

> The basic thesis of "How Asia Works" is that what works for development (going from poor to rich)
> is NOT the same as what works for rich countries. It's about industrial policy, and what works vs.
> what doesn't work.
