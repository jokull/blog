A tenant pays his landlord. But how did landlords receive legal protection to preserve ownership and
have the right to demand payment from tenants? The story of how capital influences law and how law
defines capital.

This book explains why lawyers are generally right-leaning politically and how capital buys
influence in the courtroom and with legal structures designed to maximize their accumulation and
wealth. The legal code has become an industry.
