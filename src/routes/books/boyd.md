A fighter pilot turned fighter jet engineer. Fascinating career of a man who went to great lengths
to fight the Pentagon beaurocracy for what was in his mind a superior design of Air Force fighters.
Heâ€™s credited as the father of the F-15, the F-16, and the F-18. He was an extremely deep thinker
and spent significant time trying to decrypt the creative process itself.
