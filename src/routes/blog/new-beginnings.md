Very excited to share the news that me and my spouse moved to Calgary. I recently decided to take
the offer to come and work with interesting group of people on a fast growing video platform -
Vidflex.

I love Javascript and I am very excited to meet and collaborate with new people.

Even though COVID-19 made everything harder my wife and myself enjoy greatly exploring the city and
the nearby mountains. We have Rockies only an hour away from our place. Our new neighborhood is
called Beltline and it's absolutely lovely.
